## Contribution

Any contribution is welcome. I put my ideas in todo.md, so check there if there's something you would like to help out with. Please open a pull-request if you have improved the library in any way.

## Usage

Import `main.sass` or `main.min.css` (todo: use a proper linting and building tool) in any webpage. Check showcase.html on how to use the components.
